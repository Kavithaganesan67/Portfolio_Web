        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Full Stack developer with a focus on front-end technologies, and I love building interactive and responsive websites.
            I am a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in web development. With expertise in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I specialize in building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. My proficiency in MySQL allows me to design and maintain robust databases that power seamless back-end functionality.
            I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and am committed to continuous learning. Whether working on the front-end or back-end, I focus on delivering high-quality code and creating impactful digital solutions. Currently, I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills in web development and contribute to innovative projects.
